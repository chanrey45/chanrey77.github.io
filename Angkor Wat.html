                  <p>Angkor, in Cambodiaâ€™s northern province of Siem Reap, 
                    is one of the most important archaeological sites of 
                    Southeast Asia. It extends over approximately 400 square 
                    kilometres and consists of scores of temples, hydraulic 
                    structures (basins, dykes, reservoirs, canals) as well as
                     communication routes. For several centuries Angkor, was 
                     the centre of the Khmer Kingdom. With impressive monuments, 
                     several different ancient urban plans and large water reservoirs, 
                     the site is a unique concentration of features testifying to an 
                     exceptional civilization. Temples such as Angkor Wat, the Bayon, 
                     Preah Khan and Ta Prohm, exemplars of Khmer architecture, are closely 
                     linked to their geographical context as well as being imbued with 
                     symbolic significance. The architecture and layout of the successive 
                     capitals bear witness to a high level of social order and ranking within
                      the Khmer Empire. Angkor is therefore a major site exemplifying cultural, 
                      religious and symbolic values, as well as containing high architectural, 
                      archaeological and artistic significance.The park is inhabited, and many 
                      villages, some of whom the ancestors are dating back to the Angkor period 
                      are scattered throughout the park. The population practices agriculture and
                       more specifically rice cultivation.</p>
